# Learning Objectives:
At the end of the experiment, we will be able to:

- Understand Conv2D and MaxPooling layers used in ConVNet
- Build a simple ConvNet for image classification using the digit MNIST dataset
- Build another ConvNet for image Classification using the cats-and-dogs dataset
- Apply Data Augmentation

Let's start with a simple example. We will

Build a CNN with convolution and pooling layers
Train it on the MNIST dataset
The figure below is a typical ConvNet (LeNet) architecture that we are going to build but with different numbers and sizes of filters.
