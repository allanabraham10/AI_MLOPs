# Learning Objectives:
At the end of the experiment, we will be able to:

- Understand Conv2D and MaxPooling layers used in ConVNet
- Build a simple ConvNet for image classification using the digit MNIST dataset
- Build another ConvNet for image Classification using the cats-and-dogs dataset
- Apply Data Augmentation
