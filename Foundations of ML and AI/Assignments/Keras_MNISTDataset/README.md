## Introduction to Keras
Keras is an open-source neural network library written in Python that allows you to build and train deep learning models. It provides a user-friendly and modular API for creating and configuring deep neural networks with high-level abstractions. Keras is built on top of other popular deep learning frameworks such as TensorFlow, Theano, and CNTK. It has a wide range of applications in areas such as computer vision, natural language processing, and time-series forecasting.
