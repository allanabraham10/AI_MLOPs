## Learning Objectives:
At the end of the experiment, we will be able to:
- perform preprocessing for different types of features
- build pipeline for preprocessing of features
- implement feature selection manually and automatically
- build an XG-Boost regressor model and check its performance

## Introduction
Predicting house prices is helpful to identify profitable investments or to determine whether the price advertised is over or under-estimated. Here, we will build an ML model to predict the sale price of homes based on different explanatory variables describing the aspects of residential houses.

## Dataset
The dataset chosen is a Housing dataset containing 79 features, one target feature (SalePrice), and 1460 samples. Visit the data source to understand each feature/column. Download the 'data_description.txt' file, which gives a full description.
