## Bike Rental Prediction Continuous Integration

For this project, we will build a GitHub Actions workflow to automate model training,
testing, linting, and formatting steps for the bike rental count prediction system.

- Step 1: Download the project folder in your local system:
1.1 Download the given project folder ‘bikeshare_project’ onto your system
- Step 2: On your GitHub account, create a new repository:
2.1 Create a new repository to store files related to this mini-project
- Step 3: Setup a Cloud development environment:
3.1 Setup a cloud development environment, such as AWS Cloud9, or GitHub
Codespaces.
3.2 Authenticate the communication between the Cloud dev environment to GitHub
Repository by SSH method
- Step 4: Clone the remote repository in the cloud dev environment:
4.1 Clone the remote repository in your cloud environment.
4.2 Add the downloaded project folder to this cloned repository.
4.3 Finally, push the changes into the remote GitHub repository.
- Step 5: Add files related to testing, linting, and code formatting tools:
5.1 Add additional files related to testing, linting, and code formatting, such as
conftest.py, test_features.py, test_prediction.py, pyproject.toml, setup.py, MANIFEST.in,
and mypy.ini.
5.2 Add the additional necessary dependencies/libraries to the requirements directory.
- Step 6: Run your model training, testing, linting, and formatting steps on the Cloud
environment:
6.1 In the cloud environment, create a virtual environment, and execute commands to
train the model, run test cases, linting, and formatting.
6.2 If the errors persist, debug your code and re-run.
- Step 7: Push the changes to the remote GitHub repository:
7.1 On successful execution of the training, testing and formatting commands, push
the new files and changes to the remote GitHub repository.
- Step 8: Create a GitHub Actions workflow to automate the steps for model training,
testing, linting, and formatting:
8.1 Create a GitHub Actions workflow to automate the steps for model training, testing,
linting, and formatting.
8.2 Add below event triggers to the workflow:
● Run on push to the main branch
● Run manually from the UI
